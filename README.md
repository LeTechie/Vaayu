# Vaayu

This MATLAB application calculates the cumulative signal loss by taking into consideration atmospheric attenuations which has severe effects (especially at higher frequencies) on the signal caused by atmospheric conditions. Additionally it factors in the Free Space Path Loss which occurs due to signal dispersion over a distance in a vacuum (Basically calculated by Friis equation). Furthermore the gains from both the Transmitter and Receiver antennas responsible for boosting the signal are also taken into account.

## Reason behind Naming:
"Vaayu" is named after the Sanskrit word (वायु) for "air". Since it is a tool designed to analyze signal loss over the air interface in wireless communication systems. Hence it emphasizes the tool's focus on understanding the impact of air medium on signal propagation.
